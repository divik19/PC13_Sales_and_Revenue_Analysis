**Sales and Revenue Analysis**

 Domain: Transportation & Mobility     Function : Operations



**Situation:**  
GoodCab, a cab service operating in tier-2 cities, aimed to assess its performance across key metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, and repeat passenger rates. The analysis required addressing specific business challenges, including city-wise demand variations, repeat customer behavior, and emerging mobility trends.

**Task:**  
As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing company data, including trip frequency, revenue, and passenger trends, to generate actionable insights for senior management. Additionally, I needed to identify factors influencing repeat passenger rates, assess tourism versus business demand impacts, and recommend strategies for growth.

**Action:**  
- Conducted comprehensive data analysis using SQL and Power BI to process, visualize, and derive insights from city-level performance metrics and passenger behavior.  
- Designed a Power BI dashboard to answer primary and secondary questions, including trip target achievement, high-frequency trip contributions, and revenue trends.  
- Segmented cities into tourism-focused and business-driven based on demand patterns, leveraging local event and seasonality data.  
- Proposed actionable recommendations, such as loyalty programs, EV adoption, and partnerships with local businesses and event organizers, to boost customer retention and revenue.  

**Result:**  
- Delivered a dynamic Power BI dashboard to senior management, enhancing decision-making efficiency.  
- Identified key growth opportunities, such as improving repeat passenger retention in low-performing cities (e.g., Mysore, Visakhapatnam) and leveraging high-performing cities like Jaipur and Lucknow.  
- Proposed data-driven strategies that aligned with GoodCab’s 2024 goals, resulting in a clearer roadmap for revenue growth and operational improvements.
